<p>Timeline B is an automated video publishing platform that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate and share &quot;alternative history&quot; content. The Service allows users to generate narrative scenarios, visuals, and audio based on counter-factual historical events and publish them to third-party platforms, specifically TikTok.</p>
<h2 id="3-nature-of-content-ai-alternative-history-">3. Nature of Content (AI &amp; Alternative History)</h2>
<p>By using Timeline B, you acknowledge and agree to the following regarding the content generated:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fictional Nature:</strong> You understand that all content generated by Timeline B is <strong>fictional</strong> and classified as &quot;Alternative History&quot; or &quot;Speculative Fiction.&quot; It is not intended to represent actual historical facts, real events, or accurate biographies of real persons.</li>
<li><strong>AI Generation:</strong> Content is generated by artificial intelligence. While we strive for coherence, the AI may occasionally produce content that is nonsensical or factually inconsistent within the context of the scenario.</li>
